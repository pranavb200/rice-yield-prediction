# 🌾 Rice Yield Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts **rice yield before harvest** using Machine Learning.  
It uses features like **Crop Year, Area, Rainfall, Fertilizer, Pesticide, and Temperature** to forecast yield in tons/hectare.  

The app is built with:
- 🐍 Python (Flask API backend)
- 📊 scikit-learn (Random Forest & Gradient Boosting Regressors)
- 🌐 HTML + CSS frontend
- 📁 CSV dataset (with temperature feature)

## 🚀 Features
✅ Predict rice yield before planting/harvest  
✅ Compare ML models (Random Forest vs Gradient Boosting)  
✅ Simple web interface for predictions  
✅ Upload your own dataset to test the model  
✅ Easy to deploy on **Render/Heroku/Streamlit**
